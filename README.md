# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns
  
  * ### Singleton Pattern
  
  When we need only one instance of an object, Singleton ensures that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it
  
  There are various ways to design/code a singleton class.
  
     1 - Eager Initialization Method
     2 - Lazy Initialization Method
     3 - Lazy Initialization with double lock Method
  
  * ### Factory Pattern
  
  A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an **interface** or **abstract class** for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
     
     Factory Pattern promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.
     That means the code interacts solely with the resultant interface or abstract class,
     so that it will work with any classes that implement that interface or that extends that abstract class.

## Structural Patterns
  * ### Decorator Pattern
    
     The decorator design pattern allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an **object** without affecting the behavior of other existing objects in the same class. 
    
    Suppose that, there is an ice cream shop, which makes a different types of ice creams. There are many flavours of ice creams to select. Imagine that someone went there and ordered a chocolate ice cream and mint ice cream.
    So, There will be a Ice Cream interface which will be a base component interface for both the original object and decorator object.
    
    Then we'll have a BasicIceCream class which is the actual base ice cream which use to make the customer required flavour of ice cream.
    
    IceCreamDecorator is the abstract decorator for the subsequent concrete decorator classes, and lastly flavouredIcecreams(Chocolate,Mint..) which can be one of the concrete implementation of the decorator interface. This decorator class adds desired flavour decoration to the concrete ice cream. 
    
    Desired flavor(Chocolate,Mint..) is the additional state or feature in this particular instance.
    
        When there are large number of different combinations or options for an object and
        sub-classing is not the optimal solution Decorator Pattern can be used.

## Behavioral Patterns
  * ### Command Pattern
    The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object (Game Card) thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queues or log requests.
    
    To understand command design pattern we should understand the associated key terms like client, command, command implementation, invoker, receiver.

        1 - Command is an interface with execute method. It is the core of contract.
        2 - A client creates an instance of a command implementation and associates it with a receiver.
        3 - An invoker instructs the command to perform an action.
        4 - A Command implementationâ€™s instance creates a binding between the receiver and an action.
        5 - Receiver is the object that knows the actual steps to perform the action.
    
    In Command Pattern, the request is send to the invoker and invoker pass it to the encapsulated command object.
  Command object passes the request to the appropriate method of Receiver to perform the specific action.

  * ### Strategy Pattern
    Used where you want to choose the algorithm to use at runtime. (also known as Policy Pattern)
    
    Let's assume that we have a payment system where different types of payment methods are available, for example it can be a 'paypal' or 'credit card'. First, let's create a Payment interface which will be implemented by our payment methods. 
    Then we'll create concrete implementation of methods that implements our interface.
    So, when we call desired method in our shoppingcart class it will require a paymentMethod. What this means is now we can       modify our program and choose whatever behavior we like at runtime.

  * ### Observer Pattern
    ODP defines a 1-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes its state, all of its dependents are       notified and updated automatically. In ODP, the object that watch on the state of another object are called **Observer** and the object that is being watched is called **Subject**.
